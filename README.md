## Requirements
[NodeJS][nodejs-url] & [MySQL][mysql-url]


### Set Up
1. Install MySQL on your machine
    - Set up your credentials
    - Create a database for the API

2. Set up your game_servers.json file
    - Create an endpoint pointing to this file, preferably with some sort of authentication
    - Make sure its scheme is following the schema in ```game_servers_example.json``` 

3. Fork the API
    - Run ```npm install``` to install all dependencies
    - Change ```example.env``` to ```.env``` and fill it with your information
    
4. Run the API
    - Use ```npm run build``` to build the project
    - Use ```npm run prod``` to run the production version
    - Use ```npm run dev``` to run a local dev server using [Nodemon][nodemon-url] for any further development
    
## REST Endpoints
```HTTP``` ```GET``` ```/v1.0/statistics```

```HTTP``` ```GET``` ```/v1.0/statistics/:startTimestamp```

```HTTP``` ```GET``` ```/v1.0/statistics/:startTimestamp?endTimestamp=<timestamp>```

```HTTP``` ```PUT``` ```/v1.0/statistics/```

- All requests take an ```Authorization``` Game-Server token or the Master token
- The Master Token is used to retrieve information on all servers and not just a specific one related to the given token
- Put requests require a ```player_identifier``` & ```player_address``` parameters in the body
